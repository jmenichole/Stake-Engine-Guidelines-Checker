# Gemini API Key
# Get your API key from: https://ai.google.dev/
# 
# IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTE:
# Currently the API key is exposed in the client-side code, which is a security risk.
# For production use, this should be moved to a backend API proxy.
# 
# Recommended approach:
# 1. Create a backend server (Node.js/Express, Python/Flask, etc.)
# 2. Store the API key securely on the backend (environment variables, secrets manager)
# 3. Create API endpoints that accept requests from the frontend
# 4. Have the backend make the calls to Gemini API
# 5. Return the results to the frontend
#
# This will:
# - Protect your API key from exposure
# - Add rate limiting capabilities
# - Enable better monitoring and logging
# - Prevent API key abuse
